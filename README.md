# Audio-filtering
The objective of the project is to utilize Fast Fourier Transform (FFT) to filter a noisy audio file and preserve its magnitude spectrum. The noisy audio file, named "audio.wav," is located within the repository.
## filter:
The repository contains the file "Hd_1.mat," which contains a designed filter obtained using the Matlab filter designer tool known as "filterDesigner."
## Programe's output:
- plotting of the spectrum of the noisy audio by shifting zero to the center of spectrum.   
- plotting of the spectrum of filtered audio.   
- audio after filtration(and it will be saved on your PC).  
- plotting frequency response of the filter.  
- plotting impulse response of the filter.  
- audio with double speed after filtration(and it will be saved on your PC).
